                <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra">
                    <h3>The Nabataeans worshipped Arab gods :</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>The Nabataeans worshipped <u>Arab gods and goddesses during the pre-Islamic era as well as a
                                few of
                                their deified kings.</u> One, Obodas I, was deified after his death. Dushara was the
                            primary male
                            god accompanied by his three female deities: Al-‘Uzzā,</b> Allat and Manāt. Many statues
                        carved in
                        the<strong> rock depict these gods and goddesses.</strong> New evidence indicates that broader
                        Edomite, and
                        Nabataean theology had strong links to <em> relationships, often manifested in </em>the
                        orientation of prominent Petra structures to equinox and solstice sunrises and sunsets.[60]
                    </p>
                    <h3>A stele dedicated to Qos-Allah 'Qos is Allah' :</h3>

                    <p>
                        <em> A stele dedicated to Qos-Allah 'Qos is Allah' or 'Qos the god', by Qosmilk (melech – king)
                            is
                            found at Petra (Glueck 516). Qos is identifiable with Kaush (Qaush) the God of the older
                            Edomites. The stele is horned and the seal from the Edomite Tawilan near Petra identified
                            with
                            Kaush displays a star and crescent (Browning 28), both consistent with a moon deity. It is
                            conceivable that the latter could have resulted from trade with Harran (Bartlett 194). There
                            is
                            continuing debate about the nature of Qos (qaus – bow) who has been identified both with a
                            hunting bow (hunting god) and a rainbow (weather god) although the crescent above the stele
                            is
                            also a bow.[citation needed]</em>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Nabataean inscriptions in Sinai :</h3>

                    <p>
                        <em> <b> Nabataean inscriptions in Sinai and other places display widespread references to names
                                including Allah, El and Allat (god and goddess), with regional references to al-Uzza,
                                Baal and
                                Manutu (Manat) (Negev 11). Allat is also found in Sinai in South Arabian language. Allah
                                occurs
                                particularly as Garm-'allahi – god decided (Greek Garamelos) and Aush-allahi – "gods
                                covenant"
                                (Greek Ausallos). We find both Shalm-lahi "Allah is peace" and Shalm-allat, "the peace
                                of the
                                goddess". We also find Amat-allahi "she-servant of god" and Halaf-llahi "the successor
                                of
                                Allah".[61]</b></em>
